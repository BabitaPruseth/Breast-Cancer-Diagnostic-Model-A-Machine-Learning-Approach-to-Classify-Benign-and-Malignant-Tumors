# Breast-Cancer-Diagnostic-Model-A-Machine-Learning-Approach-to-Classify-Benign-and-Malignant-Tumors

## Overview

This project involves predicting breast cancer as benign or malignant using various machine learning models. The dataset was used to evaluate the performance of several algorithms, including; Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest, GradientBoostingClassifier, and XGBoost. The models were optimized using hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to achieve the best possible accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data). It includes various features related to breast cancer characteristics, and the goal is to classify the cancer as either benign (B) or malignant (M).

## Models and Performance

The following models were evaluated:

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Achieved the highest accuracy of 98.25%.
- **XGBoost**: Achieved an accuracy of 98.25%.
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier**: Achieved an accuracy of 97.37%.
- **Logistic Regression**: Achieved an accuracy of 96.49%.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Achieved an accuracy of 96.49%.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Achieved an accuracy of 95.61%.
- **Decision Tree Classifier**: Achieved an accuracy of 93.86%.

These results indicate that SVM and XGBoost performed the best, achieving the highest accuracy, while other models also demonstrated strong performance.
